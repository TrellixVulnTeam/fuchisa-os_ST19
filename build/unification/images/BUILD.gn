# Legacy manifests
#
# These manifests mirror the manifests generated by the ZN build.
#
# Edit these targets if:
#  - a new binary was recently added to the ZN build and needs to be referred
#    to in the GN build - the edit is an addition;
#  - a binary is being migrated from the ZN build into the GN build - the edit
#    should be a removal.

# IMPORTANT NOTE: this target is now frozen, please do not add any more
# dependencies to it.
